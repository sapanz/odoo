            <p>Dear <t t-esc="user_name"/>,<br/><br/>
            You receive this email because we would like to be sure that you are the person who changed the document 
            template of company <t t-esc="company_name" /> at <t t-esc="timestamp" />. If you don't remember doing such 
            action, it means your user credentials might be in the hands of a scammer. When they get user credentials,
            scammers common schemes are the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing the footer of your document layout to invite your customers to pay invoices on a scam bank account.</li>
                <li>Changing the bank account(s) of the company (same purpose).</li>
                <li>Changing the bank account(s) for your vendors so you pay your bills on a scam bank account.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>That's why you will receive warning mails like this each time one of those actions is performed.
            If you think you are victim of a scam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Change your user password (use a strong one). Also check that you don't use the same password 
                    for other purposes as well. Those accounts could be compromised as well.</li>
                <li>Log in company <t t-esc="company_name" /> and have a look on the document layout in the general settings.
                    Check if everything is correct with a particular focus on bank account numbers displayed
                    and make corrections where necessary.</li>
                <li>If you had to fix the document layout, then check no sales invoices were sent between <t t-esc="timestamp" /> and now.
                    Contact your customers if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
