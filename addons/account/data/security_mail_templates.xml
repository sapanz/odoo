                <p>Dear ${object.name},<br/><br/>
                You receive this email because we would like to be sure that you are the person who changed the document 
                template of company ${ctx['company_id'].name} at ${ctx['timestamp']}. If you don't remember doing such 
                action, it means your user credentials might be in the hands of a scammer. When they get user credentials,
                scammers common schemes are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Changing the footer of your document layout to invite your customers to pay invoices on a scam bank account.</li>
                    <li>Changing the bank account(s) of the company (same purpose).</li>
                    <li>Changing the bank account(s) for your vendors so you pay your bills on a scam bank account.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>That's why you will receive warning mails like this each time one of those actions is performed.
                If you think you are victim of a scam:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change your user password (use a strong one). Also check that you don't use the same password 
                        for other purposes as well. Those accounts could be compromised as well.</li>
                    <li>Log in company ${ctx['company_id'].name} and have a look on the document layout in the general settings.
                        Check if everything is correct with a particular focus on bank account numbers displayed
                        and make corrections where necessary.</li>
                    <li>If you had to fix the document layout, then check no sales invoices were sent between ${ctx['timestamp']} and now.
                        Contact your customers if necessary.</li>
                </ul>]]>
