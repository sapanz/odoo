            <p>Dear <t t-esc="user_name" />,<br/><br/>
                You receive this email because we would like to be sure that you are the person who changed the bank account 
                of partner <t t-esc="partner.name" />
                <t t-if="partner.company_id">

                </t>
                at <t t-esc="timestamp" />. If you don't remember doing such action, you may be victim of a scammer.

                Scammer might be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone remote who managed to get your user credentials</li>
                    <li>Someone who had physical access to your machine as you were still logged</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Most common scam schemes are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Changing the footer of your document layout to invite your customers to pay invoices on a scam bank account</li>
                    <li>Changing the bank account(s) of the company (same purpose)</li>
                    <li>Changing the bank account(s) fo your vendors so you pay your bills on a scam bank account</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You will receive warning mails like this each time one of those actions is performed to prevent scammers to perform such action under the radar.</p>
            <p>If you think you are victim of a scam:
                <ul>
                    <li>Take security measures (change password, lock screen when away...) to avoid this issue in the future</li>
                    <li>Log in
                        <t t-if="partner.company_id">
                            company <t t-esc="partner.company_id.name" />
                        </t>
                        and have a look at partner <t t-esc="partner.name" />. If the bank account for this vendor is incorrect, fix it. Then check no bills were created (or worse, paid) between
                        <t t-esc="timestamp" /> and now.</li>
                </ul>
